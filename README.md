# Energy Flow Dashboard - Home Assistant Add-on

A beautiful, real-time energy monitoring dashboard for Home Assistant that visualizes your solar panels, battery storage, grid connection, and household energy consumption.

## About

This add-on provides a comprehensive energy monitoring interface that connects to your Home Assistant instance to display:

- **Solar Panel Monitoring**: Individual panel performance with energy, power, voltage, and current data
- **Battery Storage**: Real-time battery status, state of charge, and historical data
- **Grid Connection**: Import/export status with financial tracking
- **Inverter Monitoring**: Multi-phase power measurements and efficiency metrics
- **House Consumption**: Room-by-room energy usage breakdown
- **Backup Devices**: UPS and generator status monitoring
